# Desktop Pet Experience

The user-facing desktop-pet experience shared by settings, menus, overlays, and
their platform-specific presentations.

**Local Companion Responsibilities**:
The nonmodal command/result surface for explicitly assigned persistent work,
scheduled follow-ups and user-saved memories. Tasks own their workspace, engine,
permission and schedule parameters; these are not global Settings System domains.
The stable `companion` menu action opens this surface. The GUI-owned service
persists state and schedules workers; closing the panel preserves work, while
application shutdown cancels its owned processes and pauses interrupted tasks.
See [the companion guide](docs/QILIN-COMPANION.md).

## Language

**Shared UX Contract**:
The cross-platform agreement for information architecture, state semantics,
interaction meaning, spacing roles, and brand roles. Platform presentation may
vary without changing this contract.
_Avoid_: Pixel parity, identical native chrome

**Settings System**:
The single product surface that owns every persistent user preference. Legacy
settings may temporarily redirect into it but do not define a second contract.
_Avoid_: Modern settings, legacy settings

**Menu Action Model**:
The shared set of menu commands, canonical labels/icons, callbacks, capability
availability, and runtime enablement semantics, independent of platform
presentation.
_Avoid_: Modern menu behavior, legacy menu behavior

**Menu Layout Tree**:
A versioned tree of stable action IDs and one-level submenus. It owns order and
user visibility, explicit separators, and optional alias/icon presentation
overrides, while the Menu Action Model owns canonical presentation, callbacks,
runtime state, and platform capability. Missing actions from newer versioned
defaults are inserted beside their nearest template sibling; explicit hidden
nodes and user ordering remain authoritative.
_Avoid_: Serialized QAction, platform-specific menu order

**Menu Presentation Override**:
An optional Menu Layout Tree decoration. Aliases replace canonical labels only
at runtime while the editor retains the canonical label for orientation. Icon
overrides may select a semantic icon, suppress the icon, or reference a
validated local image with contain/cover rendering; an unreadable local image
falls back to the Menu Action Model icon.
_Avoid_: Renamed command, embedded image bytes

**Capability Unavailable**:
An action cannot exist on the current platform or build. The Menu Layout Tree
retains its position for cross-platform editing, while the current runtime may
omit it and the editor explains the capability reason.
_Avoid_: Disabled feature, hidden action

**Runtime Disabled**:
An action exists on the current platform but its owning feature is currently
off or has no configured content. It keeps its Menu Layout Tree position and is
rendered with a disabled style and explanation; changing the feature toggle
never rewrites or filters the tree.
_Avoid_: Capability unavailable, user-hidden

**Dock Recovery Menu**:
The native macOS Dock context menu that keeps core recovery actions, especially
opening the Settings System, reachable when the pet window is hidden or mouse
input passes through it.
_Avoid_: Pet context menu, tray menu

**Settings Popup Surface**:
The shared settings-menu presentation used by selectors and command buttons.
It owns popup anchoring, minimum trigger width, row geometry, disabled state,
submenu arrows, and trailing selection checks; callers only provide actions.
_Avoid_: Copied menu stylesheet, native button menu indicator

**Image Directory Preview**:
An on-demand right-side drawer for image-directory settings. It uses three
shortest-height columns, preserves each thumbnail's useful aspect ratio, labels
every card with an elided filename and full-name tooltip, and defers directory
scanning and image decoding until the user presses Preview.
_Avoid_: Inline settings grid, eager gallery

**Settings Capability Domain**:
A stable sidebar destination organized by user intent. Every persistent setting
has one owning domain; platform support changes availability, not ownership.
_Avoid_: Module page, Windows settings page

**Report Gate**:
The single control for how much of one aggregated event class the pet reports.
It is a pass probability in `0.00–1.00` (`0.00` silences the class, `1.00`
reports every occurrence) and there is no boolean switch: the settings slider is
the only fine-grained control, while the pet menu offers only the two endpoints.
A gate governs the bubble step alone — detectors and the raw-record chain are
never sampled — and it never covers the whole feature.
_Avoid_: Notification toggle, report percentage, global mute

**Gate Group**:
The collapsible settings block that collects every report gate with the
bubble-phrase rows of its own event class, so a gate sits next to what it
controls. It is expanded by default and auto-expands when a search matches a row
inside it.
_Avoid_: Hidden advanced panel, per-feature switch list

**Session-End Spawn Freeze**:
The process-wide latch armed when the operating system announces that the
session is ending (`WM_QUERYENDSESSION`/`WM_ENDSESSION`, or Qt's session
signals as a fallback). While armed, no child ffmpeg process may be spawned and
existing readers are stopped, because a process created inside a tearing-down
Windows session fails DLL initialization (0xc0000142) and blocks shutdown.
The freeze is one-way: a process that survives a cancelled shutdown stays
frozen rather than resuming animation.
_Avoid_: Shutdown option, ffmpeg kill switch
